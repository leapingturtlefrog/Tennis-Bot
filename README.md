**Tennis Bot, an Autonomous Tennis Ball-Collecting Robot**

Developed to the point of being able to collect 10 tennis balls indoors very slowly (~1/min) in a closed field.
Also had full person-controlled driving and collection (but not the main point of the project).

All the main code is in [TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/updatedDrive4](TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/updatedDrive4).

Here is a really bad picture of it:<br>
